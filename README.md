An experiment in teaching AI to play the card game Magic: the Gathering. Magic's rules and the cards from the set Magic 2020 have been fully programmed, and can play games by making random decisions. I am currently playing around with a neural network that can predict win probability based on a current board state, and building forward vision for the computer to anticipate the results of a given combat step.
